### Chapter 35: Pediatric Emergencies

**Content:**
Treating children is different from treating adults. Children vary anatomically, physically, and emotionally from adults. Their illnesses and injuries differ based on age and development. Pediatrics is the specialized medical practice for young patients. Caring for children can be challenging due to their age and developmental level.

Communication and family support are crucial in pediatric care. Caring for a child means caring for both the patient and caregivers. Family members often need emotional support, and a calm parent helps the child remain calm. Different age groups require different communication approaches: infants benefit from caregiver holding during assessment, toddlers need simple words and calm voice, preschoolers require direct communication without lies, school-aged children should be talked to directly with simple explanations, and adolescents should be involved in their own care.

Growth and development stages include infancy (first year), toddler (1-3 years), preschool age (3-6 years), school age (6-12 years), and adolescence (13-18 years). Each stage has unique characteristics affecting assessment and care approaches.

Pediatric anatomy and physiology differences are significant. The respiratory system has smaller airway diameter, larger tongue relative to mouth size, funnel-shaped upper airway, and higher oxygen demand. The circulatory system shows variable pulse ranges with age and different compensation mechanisms. The nervous system is immature and less protected, with disproportionately larger head-to-body ratio.

Respiratory emergencies are common in children. Upper airway obstruction can be caused by croup, epiglottitis, or foreign body aspiration. Lower airway conditions include asthma, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Treatment focuses on positioning, oxygen delivery, and avoiding agitation.

Cardiopulmonary arrest in children is usually respiratory in origin. Shock in children compensates well initially but decompensates rapidly. Signs include tachycardia, altered mental status, and poor perfusion. Anaphylaxis requires immediate epinephrine administration and supportive care.

Neurologic emergencies include seizures, altered mental status, and head trauma. Febrile seizures are common and usually benign. Gastrointestinal emergencies involve dehydration, which is more serious in children due to higher surface area-to-body weight ratio.

Pediatric trauma considerations include different injury patterns, anatomical differences affecting assessment, and special equipment needs. Child abuse and neglect require recognition and proper reporting. SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) and ALTE (Apparent Life-Threatening Events) are specialized pediatric conditions requiring specific approaches.

## Operations (37-39)

### Chapter 37: Special Challenges

**Content:**
This chapter discusses patients with special challenges in emergency care, covering the needs of patients with developmental, sensory, and physical disabilities. Understanding the unique anatomy and physiology of these patients is crucial. Special care is also needed for patients relying on medical technology.

Intellectual and developmental disabilities may impair physical ability, learning, language, or behavioral skills. Intellectual disability involves limitations in intellectual functioning and daily living skills, diagnosed before age 18. Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by deficiencies in social communication and repetitive behaviors. Patients may have abnormal sensory responses and require calm environments with minimal stimulation.

Down syndrome is a genetic chromosomal defect resulting in mild to severe intellectual impairment. Physical abnormalities include round head, flat occiput, and large protruding tongue. Intubation can be difficult due to anatomical differences, and approximately 15% have upper spine instability, placing them at increased trauma risk.

Sensory disabilities affect vision or hearing. Visual impairment management includes making yourself known, introducing your team, describing surroundings, and taking assistive devices during transport. Hearing impairment requires facing the patient for lip reading, lowering pitch rather than speaking louder, and considering alternative communication methods.

Physical disabilities include cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and paralysis. Cerebral palsy results from brain damage causing poorly controlled movement. Observe the airway closely, don

### Chapter 39: Vehicle Extrication and Special Rescue

**Content:**
Vehicle extrication and special rescue operations require mental and physical preparation. Priority is patient care, but personal and team safety must come first. EMTs usually assist with extrication rather than lead rescue operations.

Vehicle safety systems can become hazards after collisions. Shock-absorbing bumpers may be compressed and could release suddenly. Airbags are supplemental restraints that may not have deployed and could inflate spontaneously. Maintain proper clearance distances: 5 inches for side-impact, 10 inches for driver-side, and 20 inches for passenger-side airbags.

Alternative fuel vehicles present special hazards including electric, hybrid, propane, natural gas, methanol, or hydrogen power. Disconnect batteries to prevent fire or explosion. Hybrid vehicles may have multiple batteries with higher voltage than traditional systems. High voltage systems may take up to 10 minutes to de-energize. Avoid orange high-voltage cables and retreat if unusual odors are detected.

Roles and responsibilities vary by jurisdiction but typically include: EMS providers assess and provide medical care, rescue teams secure vehicles and provide access, law enforcement controls traffic, and firefighters extinguish fires and ensure vehicle safety. Good communication and clear leadership are essential.

The 10 phases of extrication include: preparation, en route, arrival and size-up, hazard control, support operations, gaining access, emergency care, patient removal, transfer, and termination. Each phase has specific objectives and safety considerations.

Gaining access depends on the situation including terrain, vehicle position, patient location, hazards, and vehicle stability. Simple access tries to get patients out quickly without tools, using door handles or rolling down windows. Complex access requires special tools like pneumatic or hydraulic devices and is typically done by specialized teams.

Emergency care for trapped patients is similar to other patients once the scene is safe. Perform primary assessment, address hemorrhaging, provide spinal stabilization, and manage airway and breathing. Coordinate with rescue personnel on the best removal route and participate in planning patient removal.

Specialized rescue situations include technical rescues requiring special skills and equipment. Only trained personnel should enter hazardous areas. Many team members are also EMRs or EMTs. Types include confined space rescue, trench rescue, high-angle rescue, and water rescue.

Tactical EMS involves working with law enforcement in dangerous situations. Water rescue requires specialized training and equipment. Wilderness rescue may involve prolonged care in remote areas. Cave rescue requires specialized techniques and equipment.

The key principle is that untrained personnel should not attempt specialized rescues. Know your limitations and call for appropriate specialized teams. Focus on patient care within your scope of practice while supporting rescue operations.

**Key Points:**
- Personal and team safety comes first, then patient care
- Vehicle safety systems become hazards: compressed bumpers, airbags

## Advanced Topics (40-41)

### Chapter 40: Incident Management

**Content:**
The National Incident Management System (NIMS) promotes efficient coordination of emergency incidents at all levels. The Incident Command System (ICS) is a component of NIMS designed to ensure responder and public safety, achieve incident management goals, and ensure efficient resource use.

Mass Casualty Incidents (MCIs) involve three or more patients or any situation placing great demand on equipment or personnel. Disasters are widespread events disrupting community functions and resources, threatening lives and property. Unlike MCIs, disasters can require responders for days, weeks, or months.

The Incident Commander (IC) is in charge of overall incident management. Large incidents may require unified command with multiple agencies. EMTs must know who the IC is, how to communicate, and where the command post is located. Command can be transferred to someone with more experience as incidents develop.

General staff includes command, finance, logistics, operations, and planning. Finance documents expenditures for reimbursement. Logistics is responsible for communications, facilities, food, water, fuel, and supplies. Operations manages tactical operations at large incidents. Planning solves problems and develops incident action plans.

Command staff includes the Public Information Officer (PIO), Safety Officer, and Liaison Officer. The Safety Officer monitors for hazards and can stop operations if rescuers are in danger. The PIO provides information to media and public. The Liaison Officer relays information between agencies.

Communication is critical for incident management. Integrated communications allow all agencies to communicate quickly using common terminology and clear text. Avoid 10-codes or signals on radio. Face-to-face communication helps limit radio traffic. Equipment must be reliable and durable with backups.

EMS response within ICS includes specific roles: Medical Branch Director supervises triage, treatment, and transport. Triage Supervisor counts and prioritizes patients. Treatment Supervisor locates treatment areas. Transportation Supervisor coordinates patient distribution. Staging Officer manages emergency vehicles.

Triage procedures prioritize patients based on severity and survivability. START (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) is used for patients over 8 years old. JumpSTART is used for pediatric patients. Triage categories include immediate (red), delayed (yellow), minor (green), and deceased (black).

START triage assesses respiratory status, perfusion, and mental status. Patients who can walk are minor. Non-ambulatory patients are assessed for breathing - if absent and positioning doesn

### Chapter 41: Terrorism and Disaster Management

**Content:**
Terrorism involves violent or dangerous acts that violate law and intend to intimidate populations or influence government policy. International terrorism occurs primarily outside U.S. jurisdiction, while domestic terrorism occurs primarily within U.S. jurisdiction. EMTs must be prepared mentally and physically for possible terrorist events.

Types of terrorism include religious extremist groups, doomsday cults, extremist political groups, violent supremacy groups, cyber terrorists, and single-issue groups. An alarming trend is lone wolf terrorism - violence by a single actor pursuing political change linked to ideology without outside orders or support.

Active shooter events have prompted discussion of gun laws, mental health, and casualty treatment. The Hartford Consensus recommends a THREAT response plan: Threat suppression, Hemorrhage control, Rapid extrication, Assessment by medical providers, and Transport to definitive care. EMS crews may be equipped with ballistic vests and helmets.

Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) are designed to cause mass death or damage to property and infrastructure. Acronyms BE-NICE (Biologic, Nuclear, Incendiary, Chemical, Explosive) or CBRNE (Chemical, Biologic, Radiologic, Nuclear, Explosive) help remember WMD types. Explosives have been the preferred WMD for terrorists due to relative ease of obtaining and creating.

Chemical agents include vesicants (blister agents), respiratory agents (choking agents), nerve agents, and metabolic agents (cyanides). Vesicants cause burn-like blisters and skin irritation. Respiratory agents damage lung tissue causing pulmonary edema. Nerve agents are extremely toxic and rapidly fatal, requiring DuoDote auto-injectors. Metabolic agents affect oxygen utilization.

Biological agents include bacteria, viruses, and toxins used as weapons. Dissemination methods include aerosol, food/water contamination, and infected vectors. Response includes recognizing unusual disease patterns, implementing isolation precautions, and decontamination procedures.

Radiological and nuclear terrorism involves radioactive materials or nuclear weapons. Radiological Dispersal Devices (RDDs) or
