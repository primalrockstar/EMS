## Chapters 7-33 (Missing Chapters)

### Chapter 7: Life Span Development

**Content:** Life span development examines the physical, cognitive, and psychosocial changes that occur throughout human life. Understanding developmental stages helps EMTs provide age-appropriate care and communication.

**Key Points:**
- Infancy (0-1 year): Rapid growth, fontanelles, stranger anxiety
- Toddler (1-3 years): Walking, language development, separation anxiety
- Preschool (3-6 years): Improved coordination, magical thinking
- School age (6-12 years): Concrete thinking, peer influence
- Adolescence (13-18 years): Identity formation, risk-taking behavior
- Early adulthood (19-40 years): Peak physical condition, career focus
- Middle adulthood (41-60 years): Physical changes, chronic conditions
- Late adulthood (60+ years): Multiple health issues, medication use

**Learning Objectives:**
- Describe the physical and cognitive changes in each life stage
- Explain appropriate communication strategies for different age groups
- Identify common medical concerns for each developmental stage
- Understand the impact of development on emergency care

**Tags:** development, life span, age groups

### Chapter 8: Lifting and Moving Patients

**Content:** Proper lifting and moving techniques are essential for preventing injury to both patients and EMTs. Understanding body mechanics, equipment use, and patient positioning ensures safe patient transport.

**Key Points:**
- Power grip: Palms and fingers in complete contact with object
- Power lift: Straight back, bent knees, weight close to body
- Keep back straight and locked during lifts
- Communicate clearly with partner during moves
- Use proper number of people for lift
- Emergency moves: Immediate danger to patient or EMT
- Urgent moves: Treatment requires repositioning
- Non-urgent moves: No immediate threat, normal precautions

**Learning Objectives:**
- Demonstrate proper lifting techniques to prevent injury
- Explain when to use emergency, urgent, and non-urgent moves
- Describe proper body mechanics for patient movement
- Identify equipment used for patient transport

**Tags:** lifting, moving, body mechanics, safety

## Chapters 34-41 (Remaining Chapters)

### Chapter 34: Obstetrics and Neonatal Care

**Content:** This chapter focuses on obstetrics and neonatal care, covering the anatomy and physiology of the female reproductive system during pregnancy. You will learn emergency treatment for childbirth, including the stages of labor and normal delivery. Complications of pregnancy and neonatal evaluations are also covered.

The female reproductive system includes several key organs. The ovaries are two glands containing thousands of follicles, each containing an egg. Ovulation happens about two weeks before menstruation, and the fertilized egg implants in the endometrium.

The placenta is a disc-shaped structure attached to the uterine wall that provides nourishment to the fetus. It keeps the woman's and fetus's circulation separate, though substances can pass between them. The umbilical cord connects the woman and fetus through the placenta, with the umbilical vein carrying oxygenated blood to the fetus's heart and the umbilical artery carrying deoxygenated blood to the placenta.

Normal physiological changes during pregnancy affect four major body systems: respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and reproductive. The respiratory system shows increased respiratory rates with decreased minute volumes. The cardiovascular system demonstrates overall blood volume increases up to 50%, heart rate increases up to 20%, and significantly increased cardiac output.

Common complications include gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, preeclampsia, and eclampsia. Eclampsia is characterized by seizures due to hypertension and requires immediate treatment including laying the patient on her side, maintaining airway, providing oxygen, and rapid transport. Bleeding complications include ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, abruptio placentae, and placenta previa.

Special considerations for trauma in pregnancy include recognizing two patients (woman and fetus), increased fall risk due to hormonal changes, blood volume changes that can mask shock, and vulnerability of the uterus to trauma. Seatbelt injuries and abruptio placentae are significant risks with trauma.

The stages of labor include the first stage (onset of labor to full cervical dilation), second stage (full dilation to delivery), and third stage (delivery to placental expulsion). Normal delivery involves proper positioning, controlling the head, checking for nuchal cord, and delivering the shoulders and body. Immediate newborn care includes drying, warming, positioning, suctioning, and stimulating if needed.

Neonatal assessment uses the APGAR score at 1 and 5 minutes, evaluating appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiratory effort. Abnormal presentations include breech delivery, prolapsed cord, and multiple births. Postpartum hemorrhage is a serious complication requiring immediate intervention.

**Key Points:**
- Female reproductive anatomy and pregnancy physiology
- Placenta, umbilical cord, and amniotic sac functions
- Normal physiological changes during pregnancy
- Complications: gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, bleeding
- Eclampsia treatment: side position, airway, oxygen, transport
- Trauma considerations: two patients, fall risk, blood volume changes
- Three stages of labor and normal delivery process
- APGAR scoring system for neonatal assessment
- Abnormal presentations: breech, prolapsed cord, multiple births
- Postpartum hemorrhage recognition and management

**Learning Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy and physiology of the female reproductive system during pregnancy
- Explain normal physiological changes that occur during pregnancy
- Identify complications of pregnancy and their emergency management
- Outline the three stages of labor and normal delivery process
- Demonstrate proper neonatal assessment using the APGAR score
- Recognize abnormal presentations and emergency delivery situations
- Discuss special considerations for trauma in pregnant patients
- Explain postpartum complications and their management

**Tags:** obstetrics, neonatal, pregnancy, delivery, APGAR, complications, trauma
