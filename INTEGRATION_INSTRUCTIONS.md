# ðŸ“‹ Ready to Integrate Your Study Notes!

I'm ready to integrate your `emt-chapters-final.json` file. Please provide the content using one of these methods:

## Method 1: Copy & Paste (Recommended)
1. Open your file: `D:\EMSLEARN\public\emt-chapters-final.json`
2. Select all content (Ctrl+A)
3. Copy (Ctrl+C)  
4. Paste the content in your next message

## Method 2: PowerShell Command
Run this in PowerShell and share the output:
```powershell
Get-Content "D:\EMSLEARN\public\emt-chapters-final.json" | Out-String
```

## Method 3: Partial Content
If the file is very large, share just a few chapters first to test the integration.

## What I'll Do:
âœ… Parse and validate your JSON content
âœ… Convert to standardized study notes format  
âœ… Create application-ready seed files
âœ… Generate markdown documentation
âœ… Integrate into the EMS application build

Ready when you are! Just paste your JSON content in the next message.
